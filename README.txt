1a) If you wish to build burlap from source, ensure that Maven is also installed.
2) If you dont want to build burlap from source, skip to 5
3) Compile the Java source code using burlap's instructions. This should generate a `burlap-3.0.2-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-depdencies.jar` file.
4) Copy that file into this directory and rename it to "burlap.jar"
5) Run the script using `jython main.py`
